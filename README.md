# isogame

A proof-of-concept isometric 2D game intended to teach myself how to write games for Godot entirely in Rust!

TODO:

- Figure out why the position of the "barrel" has phantom collision when transitioning levels
- Copy important player data between level transitions
	- Because it's getting everything in the group, maybe?
- Store level state between level transitions
- Implement death for the player
