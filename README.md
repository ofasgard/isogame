A WIP experimental isometric 2D game for learning purposes.

- TODO: Refactor signal usage so that logic remains in the relevant class, and the TileMapManager is only responsible for passing data back and forth, or updating the objects it manages.
- TODO: Turn pathfinding PoC into proper logic for the Wolf class.
