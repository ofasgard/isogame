# isogame

A proof-of-concept isometric 2D game intended to teach myself how to write games for Godot entirely in Rust!

TODO:

- Store level state between level transitions
- Improve the update_pathfinding() method
- Make it possible to turn without moving (turning uses up movement)
- Implement death for the player

Assets:

- https://scrabling.itch.io/pixel-isometric-tiles
